[Dan Romanchik KB6NU](http://www.kb6nu.com/) has an ebook called *21 Things to
Do After You Get Your Amateur Radio License*.  I ran across his blog while
searching after one of the things I've been tracking down ([building an
antenna I think](http://www.kb6nu.com/21-things-to-do-build-an-antenna/)).  I
encourage you to [buy his
book](http://www.kb6nu.com/products-page/general-interest/21-things-to-do-after-you-get-your-amateur-radio-license-kindle/)
if you like what you see here.

# In progress

Here are the things from KB6NU's list that I am in the middle of.  See my
other posts in this series for things I've done or not done yet.


### Build an antenna

I'm working now on a quarter wave ground plane for VHF and UHF.  There's a
repeater in Waterloo (W0MG), about 20 miles away that I would love to be
able to work.  I can hear them, but they can't reliably hear me.  I'm sure
that the stubby little antenna on my UV-5R is a big contributor to problem,
so rather than just buy a whip antenna, I'm going to try to build this
antenna.  In fact, I've already tried, but let's just say that coat hanger
are not an ideal material for soldering.

Another antenna that I'm dreaming of building is a magnetic loop, first for
receiving and then for transmitting.  These are elegant and small antennas
that in many cases have performance comparable to full dipoles.  The major
downside is the need for a high-voltage variable capacitor to tune the
antenna to resonance, especially for use in transmitting.

### Build a kit

I'm also working on this one.  My first kit build will be a 40 meter
receiver (the [Ten Tec 1056](http://www.tentec.com/products/Any-Band-Direct-Conversion-Receiver-Kit-%252d-Model-1056.html))
for getting started listening on the bands.  The homebrewers on the QRZ
forum suggested the 40 meter version as a good band to start on.  I plan to
practice copying code and listen to SSB conversations.  I also realized that
by piping the audio output into my computer, I could also decode the digital
modes such as PSK31.

### Learn Morse Code

I'm working my way through [Chuck Adams's Code Course](http://www.kkn.net/~k7qo/) which is a collection of MP3 files that work
through the alphabet and then on into more advanced material.  The code is
nice to listen to, he sends the characters quickly with enough spacing in
between for a beginner like me, and the tests on what you've learned so far
are genuinely challenging, at least for me.
