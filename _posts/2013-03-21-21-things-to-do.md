[Dan Romanchik KB6NU](http://www.kb6nu.com/) has an ebook called *21 Things to
Do After You Get Your Amateur Radio License*.  I ran across his blog while
searching after one of the things I've been tracking down ([building an
antenna I think](http://www.kb6nu.com/21-things-to-do-build-an-antenna/)).  I
encourage you to [buy his
book](http://www.kb6nu.com/products-page/general-interest/21-things-to-do-after-you-get-your-amateur-radio-license-kindle/)
if you like what you see here.

# To Do

These are the things from KB6NU's list that I still have left to do.  See my
other posts in this series for things I've already done or am doing.

### Get to know your (ham) neighbors

I've been trying to join the local VHF/UHF repeater nets on Sunday
evenings (<http://www.w0mg.net/>), but I haven't made it to a club meeting
or one of their weekly breakfasts.

### Join a club

See above.  I'm aware of our local club but I haven't joined.

### Join the ARRL

Again, I'm well aware of the ARRL, but I haven't put up the money to join.
I am all in favor of a membership organizaion like this that nationally
represents the interests of hams, but the value proposition seems limited
for me personally. This is something I will definitely do in the future.

### Find an Elmer

Online source may be of some help, but I am very interested in meeting
people locally who can help me out.  Especially as I start building
receivers and antennas, I think I'll be needing some help with advice and
instruments.

### Set up a shack

This is a tough one.  Our house is small relative to all of the people
and things that we have crammed inside, so a permanent space for a shack
is hard to come by.  Right now, I've got a cardboard box with parts and
tools and a baking sheet for my workspace, all stashed on top of a
cupboard to stay away from grasping hands.  We're moving someplace new in
August so we will see what I can carve out there.

### Go to a hamfest

The Des Moines Hamfest is coming up in a few weeks, but with the end of
the semester, this is a bad time of the year for me.  I might find
something to go to this coming summer though.

### Go to Field Day

I've got a few months before this one, but I've got it on my calendar.

### Buy QSL cards

This is a bit premature when my only contacts are local repeaters.  Maybe
when I build a receiver, transmitter, learn CW and make some contacts.

### Join SkyWarn, ARES, or RACES

I'm reading up on these, but it looks like filling out a registration form
and getting some online training.

### Participate in a contest

This will also need to wait until I am on the air more than locally, but
it seems worth dipping a toe into.  I'm not likely to become a contester,
but I'd be glad to work someone else's station during a contest.
