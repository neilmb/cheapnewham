title: Blog Reboot
---

I haven't been posting on this blog because the setup that I had been using to
generate the HTML files had bit-rotted.  Originally, the blog was built in the
Python-based static site generator [Nikola](http://getnikola.com) but the
theme setup that I had created did not survive a migration to another
computer.  In addition, I was having trouble uploading the generated site to
the web host at [qsl.net](http://www.qsl.net).

Since last year, I've been building websites for various projects using
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), primarily because of its integration with
GitHub's Pages, which provides free and automatic hosting for websites created
with Jekyll.  To get this blog back on track, I've ported it over to Jekyll so
I can continue working with the tool that I'm familiar with.

Some things haven't been transferred over yet, particularly the stylesheets,
but I am excited to get back to writing here.
