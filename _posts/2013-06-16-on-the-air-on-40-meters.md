.. description: Finally on the air on forty meters

Tonight it all came together: a wire antenna made from salvaged hookup wire
and coax, a `30 year old transceiver
<http://www.qsl.net/kd0ukc/posts/hf-for-misers.html>`_ and a homebrewed
antenna switch and dummy load.  I made my first contact on the high frequency
(HF) bands tonight.  It was on 40 meters around 7.228 MHz with `Harry KW5HP
<http://www.qrz.com/db/KW5HP>`_ in Little Rock, AR.  We had your standard
chit-chat about location, signal strength and weather and then signed off.  I
made sure to tell him that he was my first QSO and he was kind about it.

It was a great feeling to have my long, slow, cheap process of building a
station come together.  I bought the transceiver about two months ago and have
been slowly putting the pieces of a complete station together.  I got some
good advice about starting with a resonant dipole for 40 meters and starting
with success on a single band.  The microphone was an eBay purchase that I
almost screwed up poking around with.  (I broke a solder connection between
the battery and the gain potentiometer, but managed to re-solder it.)  The
dummy load I built from the `very nice plans of K4EAA
<http://www.k4eaa.com/dummy.html>`_.  The antenna switch I designed and built
myself out of copper-clad PCB material and a scrap double-pole-double-throw
switch, with some scrap BNC panel mount connectors.

Putting the antenna up in the backyard was the hardest part.  It took me a
while to get the rope I wanted; the Dayton Hamvention is bad news for all of
the rest of the country's hams who want to buy from small ham-oriented
businesses!  Then, once I had the pieces, it took me a while to find time to
get out in the backyard and throw them up in the trees.  Last weekend I
finally got the antenna up and was able to listen with it.  It pulled in
signals better than the long wire which was my first attempt at a receiving
antenna.

All week long, I've been trying to find time to go downstairs and make a
contact, but it wasn't happening.  I was also hoping to find someone to do a
scheduled contact with me, but that didn't happen.  So tonight, I threw
caution to the wind and responded when I heard someone call CQ after the end
of a conversation I had been listening to.  And I am sure glad to have finally
done it.  I look forward to lots more persistence, patience, and eventually
success.
