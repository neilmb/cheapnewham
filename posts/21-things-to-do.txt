`Dan Romanchik KB6NU <http://www.kb6nu.com/>`_ has an ebook called *21 Things
to Do After You Get Your Amateur Radio License*.  I ran across his blog while
searching after one of the things I've been tracking down (`building an antenna
I think <http://www.kb6nu.com/21-things-to-do-build-an-antenna/>`_).  I
encourage you to `buy his book
<http://www.kb6nu.com/products-page/general-interest/21-things-to-do-after-you-get-your-amateur-radio-license-kindle/>`_
if you like what you see here.

I've been using his post (not his book yet) as a guide for things I might be
interested in.  Here they are broken down in terms of whether or not I've done
them yet
