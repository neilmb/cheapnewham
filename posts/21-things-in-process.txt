`Dan Romanchik KB6NU <http://www.kb6nu.com/>`_ has an ebook called *21 Things
to Do After You Get Your Amateur Radio License*.  I ran across his blog while
searching after one of the things I've been tracking down (`building an antenna
I think <http://www.kb6nu.com/21-things-to-do-build-an-antenna/>`_).  I
encourage you to `buy his book
<http://www.kb6nu.com/products-page/general-interest/21-things-to-do-after-you-get-your-amateur-radio-license-kindle/>`_
if you like what you see here.

In progress
-----------

Here are the things from KB6NU's list that I am in the middle of.  See `the
other posts in the series
<http://www.qsl.net/kd0ukc/categories/21things.html>`_ for things I've done
and not yet done.

Build an antenna
  I'm working now on a quarter wave ground plane for VHF and UHF.  There's a
  repeater in Waterloo (W0MG), about 20 miles away that I would love to be
  able to work.  I can hear them, but they can't reliably hear me.  I'm sure
  that the stubby little antenna on my UV-5R is a big contributor to problem,
  so rather than just buy a whip antenna, I'm going to try to build this
  antenna.  In fact, I've already tried, but let's just say that coat hanger
  are not an ideal material for soldering.

  Another antenna that I'm dreaming of building is a magnetic loop, first for
  receiving and then for transmitting.  These are elegant and small antennas
  that in many cases have performance comparable to full dipoles.  The major
  downside is the need for a high-voltage variable capacitor to tune the
  antenna to resonance, especially for use in transmitting.

Build a kit
  I'm also working on this one.  My first kit build will be a 40 meter
  receiver (the `Ten Tec 1056
  <http://www.tentec.com/products/Any-Band-Direct-Conversion-Receiver-Kit-%252d-Model-1056.html>`_)
  for getting started listening on the bands.  The homebrewers on the QRZ
  forum suggested the 40 meter version as a good band to start on.  I plan to
  practice copying code and listen to SSB conversations.  I also realized that
  by piping the audio output into my computer, I could also decode the digital
  modes such as PSK31.

Learn Morse Code
  I'm working my way through `Chuck Adams's Code Course
  <http://www.kkn.net/~k7qo/>`_ which is a collection of MP3 files that work
  through the alphabet and then on into more advanced material.  The code is
  nice to listen to, he sends the characters quickly with enough spacing in
  between for a beginner like me, and the tests on what you've learned so far
  are genuinely challenging, at least for me.
