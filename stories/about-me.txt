My name is Neil Martinsen-Burrell.  I'm a math professor by profession and a
serial hobby monogamist by avocation.  I've been into (in no particular order)
knitting, weaving, fountain pens, ultimate frisbee,  and now amateur radio.  It
seems like my *modus operandi* is to get very, very interested in some
topic, learn a lot about it, make it part of my life, and then stop being so
obsessed and just keep it as a background part of my life.  I still knit,
weave, and write with a fountain pen regularly and I hope to follow that
process with ham radio.

I am currently in the obsession phase with ham radio.  I'm interested in
VHF/UHF repeaters and have done some of that.  My current growing edge is on
HF.  I'd like to get on the air, but I don't have a radio or an antenna.
Since I don't have a lot of money (due in part to my many past hobbies) I
hope to build some basic gear to start listening while I am learning Morse
Code and building/amassing the gear for transmitting.  As a computer geek, I
would eventually like to work with Software Defined Radio (SDR), especially
the `Softrock <http://fivedash.com/>`_ family of receivers and transmitters.
